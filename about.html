    <h1>Who was Jane Austen?</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p>
        Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist
        known primarily for her six major novels, which implicitly interpret,
        critique, and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the
        18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on
        marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic
        security. Her works are an implicit critique of the novels of
        sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the
        transition to 19th-century literary realism.[2][b] Her deft use of
        social commentary, realism and biting irony have earned her acclaim
        among critics and scholars.
